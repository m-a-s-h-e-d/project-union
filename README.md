# Project Union
An untitled 2.5 multiplayer roleplaying adventure game.

<b>Â© Mashed 2021</b>

## Development
Development will start upon completion of my other projects. This project will likely span over many years of development. A game design document has been in development since Mid-July 2021. A infrastructure for this game is also being mapped out and will be included in the game design document.

## Version Control
All files will be hosted on Perforce as it is better for large repositories.

## Volunteers / Team Members Needed!
As I am currently a one-man team, I would love to get some help through quality assurance, music composition, story writing, game design and graphics. A Discord server will be created near the start of development and applications to join our team will be opened.
