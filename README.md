# Project Union
An untitled 2.5 multiplayer roleplaying adventure game.

## Development
Development will start upon completion of my other projects. This project will likely span over many years of development. A game design document will be created over time.

## Volunteers / Team Members Needed!
As I am currently a one-man team, I would love to get some help through quality assurance, music composition, story writing, game design and graphics. A Discord server will be created near the start of development and applications to join our team will be opened.

## Inquiries
Any inquiries about this project can be made through my Discord DMs. You can contact me through `Mashed#7999`
